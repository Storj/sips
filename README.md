## Storj Improvement Proposals
People wishing to submit SIPs, first should propose their idea or document in the [Community Slack](https://storj.io/community.html). After discussion they should add the documented SIP as a pull request. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here. Having a SIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Active. For a SIP to become Active requires the mutual consent of the community.

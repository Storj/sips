Title: Deterministic Bucket and File Keys

Abstract
--------

Core-cli feature which will generate encryption keys based on a master starting seed, allowing users to easily transfer keys to another device, backup their present and future keys on paper, and share encryption keys either on a per-bucket or per-file basis.

Motivation
----------

Currently, all keys are generated randomly on a per-file basis and stored encrypted in the user's keyring. This does not allow any easy way for a user to syncronize keys across devices. To do this currently, it would require either trusting the bridge with keyring, creating direct connections between devices, or introducing a new asymmetric encryption scheme. None of these are easily implemented.

This proposal allows users to syncronize keys simply by typing a twelve word mnemonic into each new device. This seed will allow users to generate all of their keys deterministically for any future bucket or file.

Secondly, there is no way to make a future-proof offline backup. A backup storage device would have to constantly be updated with the latest version of the keyring. This could compromise the backup's security.

Finally, users might want to grant other users access to all the files in a bucket. Currently, this would require all file keys to be sent to the target, which would be difficult to manage. This proposal introduces bucket keys which can be used to deterministically calculate all of the file keys in a bucket. A user could share this bucket key with another user so that they can encrypt or decrypt any file in a bucket, or share it with the bridge to make an entire bucket public.

Specification
-------------

Generate a twelve word mnemonic according to BIP 39 which gives 132 bits of entropy. This mnemonic will be encrypted into the keyring using the keyring's standard method of encryption. The bucket key is generated using pbkdf2 using the mnemonic as the password, the bucket id as the salt, and other settings already used by DataCipherKeyIv. The file key is generated similarly using the bucketKey as the password and fileId as the salt. This file key then becomes the secret password to a new DataCipherKeyIv.

```javascript
DataCipherKeyIv.getHDBucketKey = function(mnemonic, bucketId){

  var buffer = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(
    mnemonic,
    bucketId,
    25000,
    512,
    'sha512'
  );
  return buffer.toString('hex').substring(0, 64);
};

DataCipherKeyIv.getHDFileKey = function(bucketKey, fileId){

  var buffer = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(
    bucketKey,
    fileId,
    25000,
    512,
    'sha512'
  );
  var fileKey = buffer.toString('hex').substring(0, 64);

  return new DataCipherKeyIv(fileKey, fileId);
};
```

### Integration

Upon starting, core-cli will check if an encrypted deterministic seed exists in the keyring. If it does not, it will prompt the user either to generate one or import one. If they choose to generate one, it will print out a twelve word mnemonic and store this encrypted in the keyring. If the user chooses to import one, he will have to enter an existing twelve word mnemonic. There will also be two new core-cli commands to print and delete the mnemonic.
